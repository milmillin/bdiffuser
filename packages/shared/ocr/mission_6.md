MISSION RULES

NEW: 4-yellow wires

The 4 yellow wires are considered to be the value "yellow." Therefore, they can be cut like any other 4 matching-value wires:

- Most often, they are cut 2 at a time by DUAL CUT.

- Occasionally, they can be cut by SOLO CUT, but only if a player has all remaining yellow wires in play:
  - either all 4 yellow wires, or
  - the last 2 yellow wires, after the first 2 have already been cut.

Reminder:
As soon as you feel ready to pass the test with your team, move on to mission #8!
