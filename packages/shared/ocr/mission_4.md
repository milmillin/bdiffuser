MISSION RULES

This mission utilizes everything you have learned so far.

- Equipment becomes usable after first cutting 2 wires that match the value shown on the card.
- There are 2 yellow wires that must be cut together (in 2-player games, there are 4 total and they are cut 2-by-2).
- There is 1 red wire that must be avoided and not cut during the mission. It must be revealed only when it is the last wire left in a player's hand.

Reminder:

As soon as you feel ready to pass the test with your team, move on to mission #8!
