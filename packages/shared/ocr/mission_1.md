Lesson 1: How to cut a wire

SETUP

Each mission lists all the required components,
including which wires to shuffle and deal to players,
who will then arrange them onto their tile stands.

¢ Wa x24 wires (only use wires numbered 1 to 6)

* Do not put(=")"i}mil cards on the board. None are
available for this mission.

¢ Default rules for all future missions:

(Note—these instructions will not be repeated.)

- Set the detonator dial to match the number of players.

- Each player takes 1 character card. You may use
your Double Detector once per game.

- Starting with the Captain and going clockwise, each
player puts 1 Info token [ij of their choice in front of
their tile stand, pointing to 1 of their blue wires that
matches the token's value.

- Finally, flip over the mission card and place it at the
bottom-left corner of the board, where everyone
can read the mission rules on the card.

MISSION RULES

On their turn, a player must cut wires by doing either:

¢ DUAL CUT: Cut 2 matching wires, 1 from a teammate
and 4 of their own. First, point to a teammate's wire
and state the value, for example, “This wire is a 9.”

> If correct, the action succeeds:
The 2 wire tiles are revealed and placed
faceup in front of their respective tile stands,
without shifting position left or right.

> Ifincorrect, the action fails:

@ The detonator dial advances 1 space.
(If the dial ever reaches the skull, the bomb
explodes and the mission ends in failure!)

@ Their teammate puts 1 Info token fj in front
of the chosen wire to show its true value.

A\: The active player must never reveal which
wire in their hand they planned to cut.

¢ SOLO CUT: The player has all the remaining
wires of the same value in their hand, either:
- Cut ALL 4 wires of a single value,
- Or, if 2 wires of a value have already been cut,
the remaining 2 wires of that value.
Reveal and place all these wires faceup in front of
their tile stands, without shifting position.
