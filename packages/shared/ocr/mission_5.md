# Mission 5 OCR (normalized)

## Front (mission_5.jpg)

Training: 2nd day of training

This is a minefield, not the yellow brick road...

SETUP

`2` out of `3` yellow wires

* Before dealing tiles:

- Randomly draw `3` wire tiles.

- In the `3` board spaces matching the values shown on the wire
  tiles, put the `3` markers with the question-mark side face-up.

- Shuffle the `3` wire tiles facedown, add `2` of them facedown to the
  pile of blue tiles, then place the third yellow tile out of play,
  without revealing it.

- 2-player setup:
  `2` out of `3` yellow wires.

MISSION RULES

NEW: `2` out of `3`

`2` of those yellow wires have to be cut together, but those `2` wires
could have `3` possible values.

Reminder:
As soon as you feel ready to pass the test with your team, move on to mission #8!
