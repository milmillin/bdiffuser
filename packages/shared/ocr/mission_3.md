Lesson 3: (NOT) cutting a RED wire

SETUP

Use `40` blue wires (numbers `1` to `10` only).

Add `1` red wire, drawn from values `1.5` to `9.5`.

From this mission onward, randomly deal a number of Info cards on the board
equal to the number of players.

If equipment `11` (`Talkies-Walkies`) or `12` (`Label =`) is drawn, discard it and
replace it with a new card.

MISSION RULES

NEW WIRE: RED

If a player cuts a RED wire, the bomb immediately explodes, and the mission ends in
failure.

NEW ACTION: Reveal Your Red Wires

If a bomb disposal expert has only red wire(s) remaining in hand at the start of their
turn, they must reveal them. Afterwards, they will not take any more actions during
this mission, but their teammates continue. This is the only way to reveal red
wires without setting off the bomb.

NEW: Visible Cards

- Do not use Visible cards at the start of a mission.
- Cut 2 wires that match the value shown on a Visible card to bring it into play; slide
  the card up in its slot to show it is now usable.
- A Visible card can only be used once. After using it, flip the card face down.

Reminder:
As soon as you feel ready to pass the test with your team, move on to mission #8!
