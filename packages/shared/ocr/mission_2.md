Lesson 2: Cutting a YELLOW wire

SETUP

Use `32` blue wires (numbers `1` to `8` only).

Add `2` yellow wires, drawn from values `1.1` to `7.1`.

Do not place equipment cards on the board. None are available for this mission.

Reminder: You cannot use the yellow Info token during setup.

MISSION RULES

On their turn, a player must cut wires by doing either:

- DUAL CUT: cut `2` matching wires, 1 from a teammate and 1 of their own.

  1. The active player points to a teammate's wire and states the value.
  2. If correct, the action succeeds and both wires are revealed and placed face-up.
  3. If incorrect, the action fails:
     - The detonator dial advances `1` space.
     - The targeted teammate places one Info token showing the true value of the targeted wire.
     - The active player does not reveal which wire in their hand they intended to cut.

- SOLO CUT: cut and reveal all remaining wires of the same value in their hand.

- NEW: CUT A YELLOW WIRE!

Yellow wires are cut the same way as blue wires (DUAL CUT or SOLO CUT). During cutting, yellow wires are considered to have the same value.

To cut a yellow wire, the active player must first have one in their hand, then point to a teammate's wire and call: "This wire is yellow."

Take the same steps as before based on whether the action succeeds or fails.

NOTE: If a yellow wire is cut by mistake during the game, use the yellow Info token to indicate its value.
